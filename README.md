### Linting Setup

This project includes ESLint with basic rules.

If you're building a production-grade app, you can enable type-aware linting using @typescript-eslint's strict configs and React-specific plugins:

eslint-plugin-react-x

eslint-plugin-react-dom

Refer to the ESLint section in the docs or project wiki for more.

### Styling with Tailwind

Tailwind CSS is already configured and ready to use. You can start writing utility classes in any .tsx or .css/.scss file.
Imported in index.css

### Production Build

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```
